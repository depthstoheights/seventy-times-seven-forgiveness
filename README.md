# Seventy Times Seven - Biblical Forgiveness & Reconciliation Journey

A comprehensive Christian ministry application for those struggling with forgiveness, bitterness, betrayal, and broken relationships. This grace-filled resource provides biblical guidance, practical exercises, and daily support for the journey toward freedom through forgiveness.

## üìñ Biblical Foundation

> "Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, 'Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?' Jesus answered, 'I tell you, not seven times, but seventy times seven.'" - Matthew 18:21-22
